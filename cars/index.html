            <h2>Short Summary</h2>
            <p>The first consumer Ford GT was produced in 2005. The car was designed to be a modern interpretation of the Ford GT40, a car that won the 24 Hours of Le Mans four consecutive times from 1966 to 1969. The car was designed by Camilo Pardo, who was the head of Ford's "Living Legends" studio. The car was powered by a 5.4L supercharged V8 engine that produced 550 horsepower. The car was capable of reaching a top speed of 205 mph and could accelerate from 0-60 mph in 3.3 seconds. The car was produced from 2005 to 2006 and a total of 4,038 units were produced.</p>
